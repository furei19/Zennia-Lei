                I did know her before, but we really didn't talk. In fact this
                was the first time we talked.

                It wasn't a long conversation in fact it wasn't even a
                conversation, but, little did we know, there were definitely a
                lot more to happen.

                This, this was the start. That day i asked for the key to our
                room at school in our group chat and turns out she was the last
                one to leave earlier.
              </h3>
              <h3>
                I asked her is she wanted to join us for a pictorial but she
                declined.

                Then she treated me and her research group with pastil, I was
                gonna pay for myself but she really insisted to pay. We ate and
                had drinks and had small talks, oh and yeah I messed up the
                drink, stabbed the plastic too hard and it spilled everywhere.
                <br /><br />
                After these events I promised her I would give her a car
                someday. <br /><br />
                I then invited her to my so called “company” well here’s me a
                year later writing this and that “company” is long gone. I was
                really eager to invite her for her skills in crochet since the
                company I made with paulo, charlz and john robert was about a
                freelancing thingy. The team would advertise her works and we’d
                get a percentage and maybe we could work together and well get
                to know each other more. Sadly, she declined the offer because
                she didn’t have enough time.

                Our conversations next were mostly about school like what to
                review, I made a few practice quizzes for us and our friends to
                use as reviewers, I remember one time she had the lowest score
                in the practice review but she got the highest score in our
                friend group when it came to the real quiz, she’s really good at
                these. <br /><br />
                At this point we were talking non stop every night just random
                topics, she told me about how much she loves horror movies
                especially chucky and the conjuring series.
